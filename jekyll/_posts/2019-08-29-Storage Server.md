## Storage Server

As OS we will we use [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/item/proxmox-ve-6-0-iso-installer)

Inside of this surrounding we will install an lite [debian](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.1.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso) version to create the server.
The server will host the NAS storage for individual users, also one general share.
All of these shares will have an backup to dropbox.
